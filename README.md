# âš¡ Introduction

## What is Spark DAO?

**Spark DAO** is a decentralized reserve currency protocol on the **Polygon Network**. Each SPRK token is backed by a basket of real-world assets in the Spark treasury, which gives it an intrinsic value that cannot fall below the backing value. Spark DAO introduces a new branch of crypto on the MATIC networks with more staking and minting than similar DAOs.

## What's unique about Spark DAO?

Spark DAO differentiates itself with a unique approach to constructing its treasury. Spark DAO holds real-world assets in its reserves, such as gold(PAXG), carbon credits (BCT), stable coins(EURT, DAI, USDC), and other synthetic assets provided by the Mirror Protocol. By holding real-world assets in the Spark treasury the protocol can reduce the volatility found with typical cryptocurrencies, thereby creating a more durable and price-stable reserve currency system.

## How can I participate in Spark DAO?

There are two ways for getting involved with our project: (1) Buying SPRK on a decentralized Exchange (DEX) or (2) Bonding on our website. Anyone can buy or sell their SPRK tokens on the open market. Once listed on a DEX, the price will be determined by supply and demand. By Bonding various coins like PAXG, BCT, and DAI for fixed periods of time, you can earn discounted SPRK tokens during a fixed vesting period.

## Why use Polygon?

Our team believes strongly in the advantages of the Polygon network. No other chain is as environmentally sustainable; MATIC is over 99.99% more carbon efficient than Ethereum. With its low transaction fees, the Polygon Network makes it easy for small investors to participate in our project. Polygon also offers an easy-to-use ETH to MATIC bridge for thoser bridging Ethereum based coins like PAXG and synthetic assets found on the Mirror protocol. Those wanting to bond these coins will be essential for the DAOs treasury and for minting SPRK.
